chromify
===============

Chromify is a plugin for
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) which augments
Chrome Packaged Apps with additional NodeJS powers. Notably, it adds the
'net', and 'http' modules. Build servers in the browser.

The http_parser.js component is built from the es-parser branch of
joyent/http-parser which you can find from my fork at tilgovi/http-parser.
